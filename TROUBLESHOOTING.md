## ?? Application Configuration Troubleshooting Guide

### **Issue: Red Dots Not Turning Green + Edit Button Crashes**

I've implemented several fixes to address these issues:

#### **??? Fixed Issues:**

1. **Edit Button Crashes:**
   - ? Added comprehensive error handling in `EditApplicationAsync`
   - ? Fixed thread safety issues with dialog creation
   - ? Enhanced `ApplicationConfigDialog` with proper exception handling
   - ? Added window owner setting to prevent dialog loss

2. **Status Detection Issues:**
   - ? Enhanced logging in `RefreshApplicationStatusAsync` for debugging
   - ? Improved default application path detection
   - ? Added immediate refresh when loading applications

#### **?? Next Steps to Fix Red Dots:**

1. **Update Application Paths:**
   - Click the **?? (gear) button** next to each application
   - Browse to the correct executable locations on your system
   - Common locations to check:
     - **POL Proxy**: Look for `POLProxy.exe` in Program Files
     - **Windower**: Look for `Windower.exe` in Windower4 folder
     - **Silmaril**: Look for `Silmaril.exe` in Program Files

2. **Verify Process Names:**
   - Open **Task Manager** ? **Details** tab
   - Find your running POL Proxy and Silmaril processes
   - Note their exact **Image names** (e.g., `POLProxy.exe`, `silmaril.exe`)

3. **Test Status Updates:**
   - Click **"?? Refresh Status"** button
   - Check status bar messages for debugging info
   - Green dots should appear for running applications

#### **?? Debugging Information:**

The enhanced logging will now show in the status bar:
- Which process names it's searching for
- How many instances were found
- When status changes occur

#### **?? Example User Flow:**

1. **Launch FFXI Manager**
2. **Go to Application Manager section**
3. **Click ?? next to "POL Proxy"**
4. **Browse to your actual POL Proxy executable**
5. **Click OK to save**
6. **Click "?? Refresh Status"**
7. **Green dot should appear if POL Proxy is running**

#### **?? If Edit Button Still Crashes:**

The enhanced error handling will now show specific error messages in the status bar instead of crashing. Check the status messages for clues about what's going wrong.

#### **? Expected Behavior After Fixes:**

- **?? Green dot** = Application is running
- **? Gray dot** = Application is stopped but executable exists  
- **?? Red dot** = Executable not found at specified path
- **Edit button** = Opens configuration dialog without crashing
- **Status messages** = Show detailed feedback about operations

The application should now be much more stable and provide better feedback about what's happening during status detection and configuration operations.
