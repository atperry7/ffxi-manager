The application provides real-time monitoring of:

## Tips and Best Practices

- **Use descriptive profile names** - Avoid generic names like "Test123"
- **Monitor the status bar** - It provides real-time feedback for all operations
- **Create a backup profile** - Save your current setup before experimenting
- **Launch timing** - Switch profiles before launching Windower or other tools
- **Regular backups** - The application creates automatic backups, but consider manual backups for important configurations
- **Hotkey conflicts** - Use Win key combinations to avoid conflicts with FFXI macros
- **Character monitor placement** - Position the floating window where it won't interfere with gameplay
- **Opacity settings** - Adjust transparency so you can see through the monitor window when needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check status messages** - Error details appear in the status bar
2. **Verify paths** - Ensure PlayOnline directory is correctly configured
3. **Review active profile** - Check which profile is currently active
4. **Restart application** - Close and restart FFXI Manager if needed
5. **Check file permissions** - Ensure the application has write access to the PlayOnline directory
6. **Hotkey issues** - Verify hotkeys are enabled and not conflicting with other applications
7. **Character detection** - Ensure FFXI is running and characters are logged in for monitoring to work
