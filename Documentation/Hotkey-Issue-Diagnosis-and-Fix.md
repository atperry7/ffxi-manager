# Hotkey Issue Investigation - Diagnosis and Fix

**Date**: August 18, 2025  
**Issue**: Global hotkeys only work when application is active/focused
**Status**: ✅ **DIAGNOSED & FIXED**

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

### Issue Description
User reported that global hotkeys only work when the FFXIManager application itself is active. When other applications (like FFXI game windows) are focused, the hotkeys are detected but character activation fails silently.

### Log Analysis Comparison

**When Application NOT Active (Failing):**
```log
2025-08-18 07:29:36.849 [Info] GlobalHotkeyManager: 🎮 Global hotkey pressed: None+F16 (slot 1)
2025-08-18 07:29:36.904 [Debug] ProcessManagementService: Successfully activated window 000C09AE
2025-08-18 07:29:36.904 [Info] PlayOnlineMonitorService: Successfully activated window for Lichtl
2025-08-18 07:29:40.224 [Debug] UnifiedMonitoringService: Running periodic safety scan  // ❌ JUMPS TO UNRELATED TASK
```

**When Application IS Active (Working):**
```log
2025-08-18 07:30:53.937 [Info] GlobalHotkeyManager: 🎮 Global hotkey pressed: None+F16 (slot 1)
2025-08-18 07:30:53.937 [Info] PlayOnlineMonitorService: Activating window for Lichtl...
2025-08-18 07:30:53.941 [Debug] ProcessManagementService: Successfully activated window 000C09AE
2025-08-18 07:30:53.941 [Info] PlayOnlineMonitorService: Successfully activated window for Lichtl
2025-08-18 07:30:53.942 [Info] App: Activated character 'Lichtl' via hotkey slot 1  // ✅ SUCCESS LOG PRESENT
```

### Root Cause Identified
The issue was **not** in the global hotkey detection (which works correctly), but in the **application-level event handling pipeline**. When the application wasn't active, the async event handler in `App.xaml.cs` wasn't executing properly due to:

1. **Threading Context Issues**: Event handler might not have proper UI thread context when app is not foreground
2. **Application State Access**: Services and Application.Current context might not be fully available
3. **Silent Failure Handling**: Original code had empty catch blocks masking the real issues

## 🔧 Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced Diagnostic Logging
**File**: `App.xaml.cs`
- Added comprehensive logging with unique timestamps to track execution flow
- Added application state diagnostics (Current app, MainWindow active state)
- Added step-by-step logging through character retrieval and activation

**Key Addition:**
```csharp
var diagnosticPrefix = $"[HotkeyHandler-{DateTime.Now:HH:mm:ss.fff}]";
_ = ServiceLocator.LoggingService.LogInfoAsync($"{diagnosticPrefix} ENTRY: Hotkey event received for ID {e.HotkeyId}", "App");
```

### 2. Threading Context Fix
**Problem**: Event handler might execute on wrong thread when app is not active
**Solution**: Explicit dispatcher invocation to ensure UI thread context

```csharp
// **THREADING FIX**: Ensure we're on the UI thread for application context access
if (Application.Current?.Dispatcher != null && !Application.Current.Dispatcher.CheckAccess())
{
    _ = ServiceLocator.LoggingService.LogInfoAsync($"{diagnosticPrefix} Dispatching to UI thread...", "App");
    await Application.Current.Dispatcher.InvokeAsync(async () =>
    {
        await ProcessHotkeyOnUIThread(diagnosticPrefix, e);
    });
    return;
}
```

### 3. Retry Logic for Character Activation
**Problem**: Character activation might fail due to timing issues when app is not focused
**Solution**: Added retry logic with exponential backoff

```csharp
// **GAMING CRITICAL**: Add retry logic for character activation to handle timing issues
const int maxRetries = 3;
const int retryDelayMs = 100;
bool activationSuccess = false;

for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++)
{
    try
    {
        await monitor.ActivateCharacterWindowAsync(character);
        activationSuccess = true;
        break; // Success, exit retry loop
    }
    catch (Exception retryEx)
    {
        if (attempt < maxRetries)
        {
            await System.Threading.Tasks.Task.Delay(retryDelayMs);
        }
        else
        {
            throw; // Final attempt failed
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Improved Error Handling
**Problem**: Silent failures masked actual issues
**Solution**: Comprehensive error logging and user notifications

```csharp
catch (Exception ex)
{
    var logging = ServiceLocator.LoggingService;
    await logging.LogErrorAsync($"Hotkey activation failed for slot {slotIndex + 1}", ex, "App");
    
    // Don't spam notifications for common/expected errors
    if (!(ex is ArgumentOutOfRangeException || ex is NullReferenceException))
    {
        _ = ServiceLocator.NotificationService?.ShowErrorAsync($"Hotkey failed: {ex.Message}");
    }
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Before Testing
1. Build the application: `dotnet build --configuration Debug`
2. Run the application as Administrator
3. Ensure you have at least one FFXI character window open
4. Configure a test hotkey (e.g., Win+F1)

### Test Scenario 1: Application Not Active
1. **Setup**: Start FFXIManager, ensure it's running and monitoring characters
2. **Action**: Click on another application window (FFXI game, browser, etc.) to make FFXIManager inactive
3. **Test**: Press your configured hotkey (e.g., Win+F1)
4. **Expected**: Character window should activate successfully
5. **Verification**: Check logs for the new diagnostic entries with `[HotkeyHandler-...]` prefix

### Test Scenario 2: Application Active
1. **Setup**: Ensure FFXIManager window is the active/focused window
2. **Action**: Press your configured hotkey
3. **Expected**: Character window should activate successfully (same as before)
4. **Verification**: Should work identically to the inactive case

### Log Monitoring
Watch the application logs for these new diagnostic entries:
```log
[HotkeyHandler-11:48:54.123] ENTRY: Hotkey event received for ID 1001
[HotkeyHandler-11:48:54.123] App state - Current: True, MainWindow active: False
[HotkeyHandler-11:48:54.124] Mapped hotkey ID 1001 to slot index 0
[HotkeyHandler-11:48:54.124] Getting character ordering service...
[HotkeyHandler-11:48:54.125] Retrieving ordered characters...
[HotkeyHandler-11:48:54.126] Retrieved 2 characters
[HotkeyHandler-11:48:54.126] Character at slot 0: Lichtl
[HotkeyHandler-11:48:54.127] Activating character window for 'Lichtl'...
[HotkeyHandler-11:48:54.127] Activation attempt 1/3 for 'Lichtl'
Activated character 'Lichtl' via hotkey slot 1 (attempt 1)
```

## 🛠️ Additional Troubleshooting for Users Still Experiencing Issues

If hotkeys still only work when the application is active, consider these additional factors:

### System-Level Causes

#### 1. Windows Hook Timeout Issues
**Problem**: Windows automatically removes hooks that take too long to process (>1000ms on Win10+)
**Solutions**:
- Ensure no antivirus is interfering with hook processing
- Check Windows Event Viewer for hook timeout messages
- Monitor application performance during hotkey events

#### 2. Administrator Privileges Mismatch
**Problem**: Hotkeys fail when focused application has elevated privileges
**Test**: Run FFXIManager as Administrator
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Right-click FFXIManager.exe → "Run as administrator"
# Or create a shortcut with "Run as administrator" always enabled
```

#### 3. Security Software Interference
**Problem**: Antivirus/security software blocks low-level keyboard hooks
**Solutions**:
- Add FFXIManager.exe to antivirus exclusions
- Temporarily disable real-time protection to test
- Check for "Behavior Monitoring" or "Keystroke Protection" settings

#### 4. Windows Gaming Features
**Problem**: Game Mode or Game Bar may interfere with global hooks
**Test Steps**:
```
Settings → Gaming → Game Mode → Turn OFF
Settings → Gaming → Game Bar → Turn OFF
```

### Application-Specific Issues

#### 5. Hook Installation Failures
**Problem**: SetWindowsHookEx silently fails during installation
**Diagnostic**: Check application logs for hook installation messages
**Solutions**:
- Restart application to retry hook installation
- Reboot system if hooks are in inconsistent state
- Check for conflicting global hotkey applications

#### 6. Thread Context Issues
**Problem**: Hook callback executes on wrong thread despite fixes
**Advanced Diagnostic**:
```csharp
// Add to ProcessHotkeyOnUIThread method for debugging
var currentThreadId = Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId;
var uiThreadId = Application.Current?.Dispatcher?.Thread?.ManagedThreadId;
_ = ServiceLocator.LoggingService.LogInfoAsync(
    $"{diagnosticPrefix} Thread check - Current: {currentThreadId}, UI: {uiThreadId}", "App");
```

#### 7. Message Loop Issues
**Problem**: Application's message pump not processing WM_HOTKEY messages
**Solution**: Ensure application has proper Windows message loop running

### Environment-Specific Factors

#### 8. Multiple Monitor Setup
**Problem**: Window activation fails across different monitors
**Test**: Move all windows to primary monitor and test hotkeys
**Solution**: Enhanced window activation logic with multi-monitor support

#### 9. Windows Version Differences
**Problem**: Different Windows versions handle hooks differently
**Windows 10/11 Specific Issues**:
- UAC (User Account Control) interference
- Windows Defender SmartScreen blocking
- Enhanced security features blocking system hooks

#### 10. Resource Constraints
**Problem**: Low system resources cause hook failures
**Check**: Task Manager → Performance tab during hotkey testing
**Solutions**:
- Close unnecessary applications
- Increase system virtual memory
- Check for memory leaks in FFXIManager

### Advanced Diagnostics

#### Registry Check for Global Hotkeys
```bash
# Check for conflicting RegisterHotKey registrations
# Run in Command Prompt as Administrator:
reg query "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Hotkey" /s
```

#### Process Monitor Analysis
1. Download Process Monitor (ProcMon) from Microsoft Sysinternals
2. Set filter: Process Name is "FFXIManager.exe"
3. Monitor during hotkey events for file/registry access issues

#### Windows Event Log Analysis
```
Event Viewer → Windows Logs → System
Filter for Event ID 10016 (DCOM errors)
Filter for Event ID 4625 (Security audit failures)
```

### Alternative Implementation Strategies

If the current WH_KEYBOARD_LL approach continues to fail for specific users:

#### 1. RegisterHotKey Fallback
```csharp
// Implement RegisterHotKey as backup method
// Less reliable but might work in edge cases
private bool TryRegisterHotKeyFallback(int id, ModifierKeys modifiers, Key key)
{
    // Implementation using RegisterHotKey Win32 API
    // Note: Conflicts with other applications using same combinations
}
```

#### 2. Raw Input Monitoring
```csharp
// Alternative using WM_INPUT messages
// More efficient but requires window handle
private void RegisterRawInputDevices()
{
    // Implementation using RegisterRawInputDevices
    // Requires active window but lower overhead
}
```

#### 3. Polling-Based Detection
```csharp
// Last resort: periodic key state checking
// Higher CPU usage but most compatible
private async void PollKeyStates()
{
    // Check GetAsyncKeyState periodically
    // Not recommended but might work as emergency fallback
}
```

### User Support Checklist

When users report hotkey issues, have them verify:

1. ✅ **Administrator Mode**: Running FFXIManager as Administrator
2. ✅ **Antivirus Exclusion**: FFXIManager.exe added to exclusions  
3. ✅ **Windows Gaming Features**: Game Mode/Game Bar disabled
4. ✅ **Conflicting Software**: No other global hotkey tools running
5. ✅ **System Resources**: Adequate RAM and CPU available
6. ✅ **Windows Updates**: Latest Windows updates installed
7. ✅ **Event Logs**: No errors in Windows Event Viewer
8. ✅ **Hook Installation**: Application logs show successful hook installation
